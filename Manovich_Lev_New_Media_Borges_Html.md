## Software Design and Modern Art: Parallel Projects
- new media as **parallel tendencies** in modern art and computing technology after the WWII (**temporal parallelism**)  
- [ARG] this parallelism changes the relationship between art and technology  
- [ARG] technologies overtook art
- - [P] new media tech actualized the ideas behind projects by artists, and extended them further than the artists originally imagined.
- - [C] these technologies themselves have become the greatest art works of today.
- - i.e. the greatest hypertext is the Web itself, it is more complex than any novel that could have been written by a single human writer...the greatest avant grad film is software such as Final Cut Pro...which contains the possibilities of combining together thousands of separate tracks into a single movie.
- - "the computer scientists who invented these technologies...are the important artists of our time, maybe the only artists who are truly important and who will be remembered from this historical period."
- - [N]^ aka, the potentiality of the medium/tool is more important than art?? aka McLuhan???  
- **structural parallelism**: manifesto -- theoretical program; completed artworks -- working prototypes  
- [AS] institutions of modern culture are always behind the times  
- [AS] in general, our official cultural histories tend to privilege art over mass industrial culture  
- - "no cultural field...has remained more unrecognized than computer science...in particular, its specific branch of **human-computer interaction**(HCI)"  
- - [ARG]"...people will recognize... that the *true* cultural innovators of the last decades of the *twentieth century* were interface designers, computer game designers, music video directors and DJS -- rather than painters, filmmakers, or fiction writers, whose fields remained relatively stable during this historical period."  
## What is New Media? Eight Propositions
### 1. New Media versus Cyberculture.
- - [D] cyberculture: study of various **social phenomena** associated with the Internet and other new forms of *network* communication  
- - cyberculture: does not directly deal w/ new cultural *objects* enabled by network communication technologies
- - the study of these *objects* is the domain of *new media*
- - *new media* is concerned with objects and paradigms enabled by *all* forms of computing and not just by *networking*  
### 2. New Media as Computer Technology Used as Distribution Platform
- - [D] **new media**: **cultural objects** which use digital computer technology for **distribution and exhibition**...other cultural objects which use computing for production and storage but not for final distribution (i.e. magazines, tv programs) are not new media.[R]«The Language of New Media»  
- problems with definition: 1. has to be revised constantly (i.e. analogue to digital tv) 2. eventually *most* forms of culture may use computer distribution 3. effects of computer-based distribution on the **aesthetics** of *what is being distributed*  
### 3. New Media as Digital Data Controlled by Software
