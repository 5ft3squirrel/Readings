## Introduction: The Screen
- problem: What is (traditional Chinese) painting?
- answers: either intrinsic analysis of style & iconography or extrinsic study of contexts.
- missing: discussion of painting's physical form (i.e. as framed canvas, plastered wall, scroll, album, fan, screen)
- Wu Hung arg: «painting must be understood both as an image-bearing object and as an pictorial image; the collaboration and tension btw those two aspects makes a work a <painting>»
- **screen**: 1. object (occupies a 3D space) 2. painting medium (ideal surface for painting) 3. pictorial representation (motif in Chinese painting).
- screen transforms space into **places** that are definable, manageable, and obtainable.
^^i.e.  Ma Yuan painting: screen --psychological relationship--> person: person in encircled area perceived as belonging to him; screen blocks unwelcome gaze, sense of privacy, guarantees he be the only spectator of the landscape, defines a place exclusively subjected to his vision.
- screen as political symbol: emperor faces South in front of a screen (Book of Rites 禮記)
- early 周 court ceremony: screen is the only furnishing mentioned in the text. model for constructing symbolic space pertaining to countries political structure: emperor as center, frontal-facing, in front of screen; inner circle: officers; beyond four gates: four "barbarian tribes". unity of the emperor and the screen. **screen symbolizes space that is a miniaturization of larger geographic and political sphere known as China** (Positions in the Bright Hall 明堂位)
- screen **frames** internal or external </br>
^^ scholars on frame: «Poetics of Composition» 1973: creates necessary boundaries and transitions btw **«realities»** of diff standards of space, time, ideas, behavior; «Aspects of Intertextuality in Folklore and Literature» 1978: articulates texts from contexts and arranges texts and contexts in a hierarchy.
