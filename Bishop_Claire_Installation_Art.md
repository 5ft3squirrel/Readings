# Installation Art, A Critical History
available through UCSD library</br>
## 1. The Dream Scene
- Kabokov: often mimic museums, encroach upon the role ofthe curator.
-  *international surrealist exhibition* (Paris 1938, 1947, 1959, NY 1942) aka Duchamp's coal sacks.
- -  site: Galarie des Beaux-Arts, grandoise decor needs to be transformed to fit surrealist aesthetic.
- -  ^^ i.e. bed on each of four corners, Dali pound with lilies,Peret's coffee roasting machine.
- -  held in darkness on opening night.</br>
- - George Hugnet: "station for imagination and the dream". steam roller, train analogy.
^^ resonates w/: André Breton: «convulsive beauty» - « happiness, anxiety, panic, joy, terror... in the face of an apparently harmless object or incident»
^^ desire + anxiety: regarded by surrealists as having revolutionary potential.
###environments & happenings
- the exhibition as «actualizations of the spaces within the <painted dream>, Dalí-Magritte wing of the group» (Lewis Kachur)
- Allan Kaprow (b. 1927): immersive env with second hand materials, found objects
^^ Kaprow rejects commercial galleries: still-born, sterile, spaces for looking not touching. Instead: environments that were «organic, fertile, dirty».
^^ partial reason: desire for **immediacy**: **directly employ** objects rather than **representation**
	«...Not satisfied with the suggestion through paint of our senses, we shall utilize the specific substances of sight, sound, movements people, odors.Objects of every sort are materials for the new art...»
^^ i.e. **Words** (1962): scored responsibility for the «rearrangeable environment of light and sounds»
^^ NOTE: OULIPO MUCH?
^^ insistence on "flux, change, disorder"
- Kaprow influence: Cage (relying on contingent phenomena, i.e. coughs, etc. during 4'33''), Pollock, John Dewey («Art as Experience» argued Jeff Kelley).
- Kaprow writings: i.e. «Notes on the Creation of a Total Art», «Assemblage, Environments, and Happenings», «Happenings in the New York Scene»
- galleries: not suitable for the transformative potential of aesthetic experience, synonymous with the eternal and the canonical.
- **materials and objects**: not random, but representative of their **class of things** (i.e. everyday usage, industrial waste, memoirs, etc), bears **indexical traces of prev usage**-> therefore: «high degree of associational meaning, intended to stir the observer on an unconscious, alogical level»
- Bishop: Kaprow works similar to Surrealist art in pursuit of horror and unheard of happenings. However: **shock of dirty and the new** in Kaprow **confirms** the viewer's sense of self-presence. Surrealist immediacy «steals our sense of self-presence» (Breton, self-dislocation).
### Realism in the 1960s
- i.e. Claes Oldenburg: rented shop, named it The Ray Fun Mfg. Co. (1961), studio + front room ("The Store", displays and sells his sculptures).
^^ part of it became Bedroom Ensemble of 1963, presented as **tableau**, closed-off, **inaccessible to viewer**
- i.e. Bianchi Gallery, The American Supermarket (1964), show as way to display and sell work of Pop artists (Warhol, Watts, Johns).
^^ real cans of Campbell soup and Warhol's camel's soup.
^^ similarities btw shopping for food and shopping for art.
^^ two modes of engagement: 1. connoisseurial detachment of aesthetic judgement 2. hands-on "absorbed shopper" involved in everyday chores (particularly assoc. with female consumers) (A Taste for Pop, Cécile Whiting).
^^ experience related to **window-dressing**, **retail experience**
- Lucas Samaras: found works of Oldenburg, Segal, and Kienholz to be unsatisfactory. figures, not viewers in the environment.
	«...none of the was really concerned with a **complete** environment, where you could open the door, walk in, and be in a **complete** artwork.»
	^^ echoes: gesamlunstwerk
- i.e. Lucas Samaras, Room (1964): fully immersive, addressed directlyy to the viewer (not detached onlooker but the focus of the work). visual: personal ephemera, recreation of room, radio left playing.
- installation v. tableau = dreaming (viewer is the protagonist) v. fantasy (identify w a figure, viewer is not psychological center of the work) (ref. Jean laplanche, Jean Bertrand Pontalis, psychoanalysts).
