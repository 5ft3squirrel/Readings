## chapter I
McLuhan:</br>
⋅⋅⋅ "Philosophers of Western world excluded all technology from the matter-form in *entelechy* treatment"
⋅⋅⋅ techne excluded from philosophy
⋅⋅⋅ only natural and living forms are classified as hylo-morphic</br>
Kittler:</br>
⋅⋅⋅ **form and matter** stem originally from **technical**, they are only transferred to natural things.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ∵ the **opposition of form and matter** stems from technology, not from natural and living forms. (Heidegger《Origin of the Artwork》)</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ∴ ontology systematically excluded media technologies from its domain. (Heidegger《Origin of the Artwork》)</br>
⋅⋅⋅ **being** is thought of in metaphysical terms of *enteléchia* and *ousia*, not in its opposites, such as storage and transmission.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ but: "media in Aristotle do exist...as part of his theory of psychophysical man."</br>
⋅⋅⋅ i.e.: "'On the Senses'...**perception** must presuppose **physical media** or elements in order to connect some actually **perceived form/matter-being** with the **perceiving animal soul**"</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ which contrasts: the atomistic view that "imperceivably small images (*eidola*) separate themselves from a given object, travel through to kenón (the vacuum, void space), in order to finally arrive at the gates of our eyes or ears."</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ i.e.1. in hearing, must be air btw the thing and the eardrum and btw the eardrum and the cochlea.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ i.e.2. in seeing, must be air btw thing and human iris and water btw iris and retina.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ ref: fire water air earth, Aphrodite divine roots.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ but: Aristotle speaks of air and water as two **betweens** (tò metaxú).</br>
⋅⋅⋅ from metaxú to tò metaxú: not vacuum anymore, but a mediatic relation.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ∴ there is medium in Aristotle.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ "the medium is the message": not a thing for Aristotle bc there is no distinction btw oral sounds and their written representation.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ i.e. poetry and music close in Greek culture</br>
Derrida:</br>
⋅⋅⋅ "the metaphysics always already forgets technical media, from writing itself up to the written book, its own precondition."</br>
