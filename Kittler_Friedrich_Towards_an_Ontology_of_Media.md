## before I
Heidegger as beginning of more consciousness for technical media
## part I
McLuhan:</br>
⋅⋅⋅ "Philosophers of Western world excluded all technology from the matter-form in *entelechy* treatment"
⋅⋅⋅ techne excluded from philosophy
⋅⋅⋅ only natural and living forms are classified as hylo-morphic</br>
Kittler:</br>
⋅⋅⋅ **form and matter** stem originally from **technical**, they are only transferred to natural things.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ∵ the **opposition of form and matter** stems from technology, not from natural and living forms. (Heidegger《Origin of the Artwork》)</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ∴ ontology systematically excluded media technologies from its domain. (Heidegger《Origin of the Artwork》)</br>
⋅⋅⋅ **being** is thought of in metaphysical terms of *enteléchia* and *ousia*, not in its opposites, such as storage and transmission.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ but: "media in Aristotle do exist...as part of his theory of psychophysical man."</br>
⋅⋅⋅ i.e.: "'On the Senses'...**perception** must presuppose **physical media** or elements in order to connect some actually **perceived form/matter-being** with the **perceiving animal soul**"</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ which contrasts: the atomistic view that "imperceivably small images (*eidola*) separate themselves from a given object, travel through to kenón (the vacuum, void space), in order to finally arrive at the gates of our eyes or ears."</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ i.e.1. in hearing, must be air btw the thing and the eardrum and btw the eardrum and the cochlea.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ i.e.2. in seeing, must be air btw thing and human iris and water btw iris and retina.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ ref: fire water air earth, Aphrodite divine roots.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ but: Aristotle speaks of air and water as two **betweens** (tò metaxú).</br>
⋅⋅⋅ from metaxú to tò metaxú: not vacuum anymore, but a mediatic relation.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ∴ there is medium in Aristotle.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ "the medium is the message": not a thing for Aristotle bc there is no distinction btw oral sounds and their written representation.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ i.e. poetry and music close in Greek culture</br>
Derrida:</br>
⋅⋅⋅ "the metaphysics always already forgets technical media, from writing itself up to the written book, its own precondition."</br>
## part II
⋅⋅⋅ opening: "thinkers tend to forget their very medium." </br>
⋅⋅⋅ ---------------------------------</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ⥥ "ontology's own media history"</br>
⋅⋅⋅  ^^ i.e. greek lógos: first means that all the reasons which we give are tantamont to all the grounds in nature that we talk about. (encyclopedia brittanica:  "the divine reason implicit in the cosmos, ordering it and giving it form and meaning")</br>
⋅⋅⋅  ^^ latin logos: 1. oratio 2. ratio (wikitionery: ratio: "reason, explanation, calculation, account", oratio: "speech, discourse, language, the power of speech, imperial message")</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ aristotelian duality (signifier v. signified) -> hellenistic trinity (signifiers, signified, ta tunchana)</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ conclusion: language no longer coextensive with Being, speech and text as poor media.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ Christianization of Roman Empire: Augustine have to compare 3 diff conflicting book traditions.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ Christian writers: writch from papyrus volumes to **bound parchment books**.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ result: made simultaneous comparisons and concordances btw diff source books easier.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ^^ i.e. Socrates, Aristotle discuss philosophers before them in simple chronological order, Thomas Aquinas has access to wide range of books.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ **printing press and typesetting**: books became more vernacular and more national
⋅⋅⋅ ^^i.e. Descartes started new kind of ontology, wrote most books in French and published them in Protestant Netherlands. his ontology is like a branch of elementary algebra.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ⥣ conclusion: <mark>"philosophy completely neglected its own technical media."</mark></br>
⋅⋅⋅ ---------------------------------</br>
⋅⋅⋅ Heidegger:</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ "destruction of metaphysics" -> actual presence was not the most noble ontologic attribute.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ by: twofold absence of future and past: ourselves<--distinguished from -->others</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ **distance**: prominent to our being-in-the-world.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ **matter**: not just Aristotelian matter, but relate to nature i.e. leather shoes</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ **place**: not Cartesian coordinates, but relate to our walking and seeing, our senses.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ ^^i.e. a friend is nearer to a myopic than the asphalt of the road and glasses on his nose. voice of someone we call is nearer than the telephone receiver itself.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ finally: "modern man has become a consumer of radio news which distracts him with worldwide news from his **existential authenticity**."</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ ontology: turns into ontology of "dustances, transmissions, and media."</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ i.e. radio: as man's existential tendency to dedistanciate, to diminish distances.</br>
- [ ] Kittler: "postwar computers cannot be thought of anymore as external and extensive objects which our immaterial cartesian subject represents to itself. On the contrary, computer technology on the one hand and man on the other are inseparately linked by an endless feedback loop, by technology's essence as the danger itself...recursion should start with the earliest Greek thinker-poets, pass to Asistotle's fatal distinction btw physics and logic, and lead to our latest logical and aristhmetical machinery."
⋅⋅⋅ 1. "technical media are the visible side of some moon whose dark side would be mathematics and physics".</br>
⋅⋅⋅ 2. form v. matter ---maths, computer science---> commands addresses, data.</br>
