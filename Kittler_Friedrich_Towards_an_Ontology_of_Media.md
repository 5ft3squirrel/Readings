McLuhan:</br>
⋅⋅⋅ "Philosophers of Western world excluded all technology from the matter-form in *entelechy* treatment"
⋅⋅⋅ techne excluded from philosophy
⋅⋅⋅ only natural and living forms are classified as hylo-morphic</br>
Kittler:</br>
⋅⋅⋅ **form and matter** stem originally from **technical**, they are only transferred to natural things.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ∵ the **opposition of form and matter** stems from technology, not from natural and living forms.</br>
⋅⋅⋅ ∴ ontology systematically excluded media technologies from its domain.</br>
