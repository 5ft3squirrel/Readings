## Abstract
[Q] “Script—having found, in the book, a refuge in which it can lead an autonomous existence—is pitilessly dragged out into the street.” ([R] Benjamin, One Way Street)
^^ [N] view of writing as not having originated in the streets but in **books** -- is it true???
- tech --> data visible, writer invisible (IS THAT TRUE??? Kenneth Goldsmith isn't invisible).
“conceptual and digital poetry can be seen as embracing a “data poetics” attuned to the materiality of language”
## I. Towards a Data Poetics.
[R] William Carlos Williams, «The Wedge» 1944: poem = «a small (or large) machine made of words»
^^ indication: modern technologies symbolize ideal efficiency, poetry of economy.
[R] Stephane Mallarmé, «Crisis in Poetry»: writing on fin-de-siècle, need to emphasize sonic and visual qualities of text: «the elocutionary disappearance of the poet, who cedes initiation to words»
[THESIS] “...twenty-first century innovative poetry responds to the proliferation of information by crafting a data poetics that “cedes the initiative to words” by embracing the flow of information around us.”
[T1] text "as field of data permuted by reader + author", reveals network of relations of each part to the whole. leads to **redefinition of authorship** -- breaks away from -->the "perceived tyranny of **inspiration**"([N] very religious term here) --> in favor of --> "poetics of collaboration with the flow of information around us" ([R] Walter Benjamin, destruction of aura)
^^ which the author sees as contrary to Lev Manovich's view of it being an remix aesthetic facilitated by digital technology ([R] Lev Manovich, «New Media from Borges to HTML»)
[P1] contemporary poets cannot rely on "originality" ([N] yet another religious term here) ([R]Marjorie Perloff, «Unoriginal Genius: Poetry by Other Means in the New Century»)
[P2] poststructuralist theory: self constructed by language, media, social structures
[C2] writers can no longer assume stable center from which to write or position of privilege
[T2] as part of --> larger movement to aesthetize information through data visualization.
## II. Visualizing the Data Cloud
